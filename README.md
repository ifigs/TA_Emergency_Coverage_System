# TA_Emergency_Coverage_System

This is a system that lets invited TAs create an account and input their schedules in a calendar.
There are two types of events: TA events and non-TA events.
If an emergency arises and a TA can no longer supervise a class or lab they are responsible for,
they can click on the event and select "Find Replacement." A list of qualifies, available TAs will then pop up.
This will only work for TA events.

To see how a TA account works, you can use the following credentials:

username: santaclara
password: taemergency
